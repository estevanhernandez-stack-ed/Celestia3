# 🗺️ User Guide: The Traveler's Handbook 🌌🧪

Welcome to **Celestia 3**, your bridge between the stars and your digital self. This guide will help you navigate the Astro-Numerical Nexus.

## 🧭 First Contact: The Onboarding
When you first enter the nexus, follow these steps to calibrate your soul record:
1. **Enter your Birth Day:** Not just the date, but the exact time. This ensures your Natal Compass is accurate down to the arc-second.
2. **Select your Paradigm:** Do you walk the path of the *Picatrix*, *Hermetica*, or *Agrippa*? Your choice filters all AI insights.
3. **Calibrate Location:** We need your coordinates to see the sky as you did at birth.

## 🎞️ The Aura Scanner
- Click the **Aura Cam** in the sidebar.
- Allow camera access and capture your current vibe.
- **Gemini 3 Vision** will analyze your image and generate a procedural aura artifact and a poetic energy reading.

## 🦾 The Oracle (Athanor)
Located in the bottom-right chat bar:
- Ask about your current transits.
- Request a custom ritual.
- The assistant is **Agentic**—it can "hear" the planets and play their orbital frequencies if you ask.

## 🎖 Ascension Levels

- **Level 5:** Unlocks the **Grimoire** (Master's Archive).
- **Level 7:** Unlocks **Chronos Mode** (Real-time Transit feed).

## ❓ FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

### Q: Why is my Natal Chart slightly different from other sites?
**A:** We use the **Swiss Ephemeris (WASM)**, the research-grade standard used by professional astronomers. Most sites use simplified calculations; we provide arc-second precision.

### Q: What is "Arithmancy"?
**A:** It is the mathematics of resonance. Your name and birthdate are reduced to their core Pythagorean numbers to see your "Daily Pulse."

### Q: How do I save my readings?
**A:** Readings are automatically saved to your **Grimoire** once you reach Level 5. Before that, they are held in ephemeral session memory.
