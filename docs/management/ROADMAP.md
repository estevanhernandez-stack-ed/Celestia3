# 🗺️ Roadmap & Vision: Ascension Level Zero 🌌🧪

Celestia 3 is just the beginning of the "Astro-Numerical Nexus." This document outlines our trajectory towards a fully decentralized spiritual intelligence.

## 📍 Phase 1: Stabilization (Current)
- **Gemini 3 Pro Integration:** Full multi-modal support for Aura Scanning.
- **WASM Precision:** Swiss Ephemeris baked into the core engine.
- **Persistence Mesh:** Firestore sync for Level, XP, and Grimoire.

## 📍 Phase 2: Decentralization (Q2 2026)
- **Encrypted Journals:** Moving personal Grimoire entries from Firestore to **IPFS with AES-256 encryption** (user-held hex keys).
- **Celestial DAO:** Initial planning for community-driven lore injection into the `KnowledgeService`.

## 📍 Phase 3: Hardware & IoT (Q4 2026)
- **Aether Bridge:** A lightweight protocol to sync Athanor rituals with smart home lighting (Philips Hue resonance) and sound systems.
- **Physical Talismans:** NFC-linked physical artifacts that grant permanent XP boosts or unlock secret planetary nodes.

## 🛡️ Risk Management Register

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| AI Latency | Medium | Implement local "Hallucination" placeholders and better streaming UI. |
| API Costs | High | Strict server-side rate-limiting and tiered feature access (Level gates). |
| Data Privacy | Critical | Move towards the E2E encrypted IPFS model defined in Phase 2. |
| Browser WASM Support | Low | Provide gracefully degraded fallback to standard trigonometric astrology. |
